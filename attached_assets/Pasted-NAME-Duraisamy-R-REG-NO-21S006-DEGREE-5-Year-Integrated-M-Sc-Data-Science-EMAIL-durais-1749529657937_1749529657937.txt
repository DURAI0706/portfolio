for above profile design a portfolio in the below mentioned style
Create a dynamic, interactive fresher portfolio website using Node.js with Express for the backend and either React (with Vite or Next.js) or EJS for the frontend templating. The website should have a sleek black background with a smooth gradient animation (such as a shifting dark blue‚Äìpurple‚Äìblack blend), giving it a modern, tech-savvy aesthetic that reflects a coding personality. The homepage should feature a typing animation that introduces the user (Duraisamy R) with key highlights like "Aspiring Data Scientist | Python & ML Enthusiast | Creative Thinker". Sections should include About Me, Skills, Projects, Internships, Resume Viewer, and Contact Form (using EmailJS or Nodemailer).
The standout feature should be the auto-updating social feed integration: fetch the latest GitHub repositories (via GitHub API), Medium blog posts (via RSS feed), and optionally LinkedIn activity (via scraping APIs or RSS proxy). Schedule this fetching with node-cron to refresh the content every few hours or use real-time webhooks when available. Use MongoDB or a JSON store to cache this content for performance.
Styling should be done using Tailwind CSS, and the UI must be fully responsive across devices with smooth transitions, tabbed navigation for skills/projects, and animated counters showing project count, blogs written, etc. Use Framer Motion or GSAP to animate components for an engaging experience. In the footer, prominently link to LinkedIn, GitHub, and Medium, with logos and hover animations. Optionally, include a theme switcher (dark/cyberpunk/hacker green) and a command-line style intro like npx duraisamy-portfolio for geek appeal.
The final result should be a live, portfolio-as-a-service that updates itself whenever you post a blog, push a GitHub repo, or update your profiles ‚Äî showcasing your journey as a modern, well-rounded data science graduate.
